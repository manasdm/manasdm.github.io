The joint posterior distribution of the model matrices and the unknown state sequence is approximated by using Rao-Blackwellized Monte-Carlo sampling algorithms. Specifically, the conditional distribution of the state sequence given the model parameters is derived analytically, while only the marginal posterior distribution of the model matrices is approximated using a Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte-Carlo sampler. From the joint distribution, MAP estimates of the unknown model matrices as well as the state sequence are computed.

In the first stage, a moving horizon strategy is employed to simultaneously estimate the model parameters and to classify the training data by solving a small-size mixed-integer quadratic programming problem. In the second stage, linear multicategory separation methods are used to partition the regressor space. The framework of PWA regression is adapted to the identification of PWA AutoRegressive with eXogenous input (PWARX) models as well as linear parameter-varying (LPV) models. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on an academic example and on two benchmark experimental case studies. The first experimental example concerns modeling the placement process in a pick-and-place machine, while the second one consists in the identification of an LPV model describing the input-output relationship of an electronic bandpass filter with time-varying resonant frequency.

For an output-error type noise structure, the algorithms based on ordinary least squares (LS) fail to compute a consistent estimate of the sub-model parameters. On the other hand, the prediction error methods (PEMs) provide a consistent parameter estimate, however, they require to solve a non-convex optimization problem for which the numerical algorithms may get trapped in a local minimum, leading to inaccurate estimates. In this letter, we propose a recursive bias-correction scheme for identifying PWA-OE models, retaining the computational efficiency of the standard LS algorithms while providing a consistent estimate of the sub-model parameters, under suitable assumptions. The proposed approach allows one to recursively update the estimates of the sub-models parameters and to cluster the regressors. Linear multi-category techniques are then employed to estimate a partition of the regressor space based on the estimated clusters. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated via an academic example.

In this paper, we present a bias-correction scheme for closed-loop identification of Linear Parameter-Varying Input–Output (LPV-IO) models, which aims at correcting the bias caused by the correlation between the input signal exciting the process and output noise. The proposed identification algorithm provides a consistent estimate of the open-loop model parameters when both the output signal and the scheduling variable are corrupted by measurement noise. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is tested in two simulation case studies.

However, certain applications demanding fast dynamic response are restricting usage of FC on account of its lifetime issues. Slow dynamic response of FC is not suitable to provide transient load demands, typically arising in electrical vehicles during acceleration and in braking. This paper presents a novel control strategy and associated power electronics for such applications. We propose a Lure-Lyapunov-based controller executed in cascade mode for the control of hybrid energy management system of FC and ultracapacitor (UC). In the proposed scheme, UC responds to transients in load demand whereas FC takes care of the nominal load bus requirements. This combination helps in improving lifetime of FC as auxiliary storage device such as UC provides a cushion for sudden transients. The proposed control strategy also helps in maintaining state of charge of UC for better performance. The inherent nonlinearities in DC-DC converter are efficiently handled by the outer-loop Lure-Lyapunov framework. Mathematical modeling and a proof for absolute stability of the system is presented. The proposed controller strategy is robust by virtue of being passivity based control methodology. The paper also presents analysis of the required power electronics involving DC-DC converters and inner-loop current control action. The synthesized controller is experimentally validated and the results are presented with their analysis.
